## Problem 2
First, let's load the data.
``` {r}
atp_matches <- read.csv("data/atp_matches_2019.csv")
```

a. How many tournaments took place in 2019?
``` {r}
```

b. Did any player win more than one tournament? If so, how many players won more than one tournament, and how many tournaments did the most winning player(s) win?
``` {r}
```

c. Is there any evidence that winners have more aces than losers?
``` {r}
```

d. Identify the player(s) with the highest win-rate. (Note that this is NOT asking for the highest number of wins.) Restrict to players with at least 5 matches.
``` {r}
```
